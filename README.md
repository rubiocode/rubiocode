### Hi there <img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/3b388fe03da271d2674faf85eb7c3fcd/tenor.gif" width="50px">, welcome to my page!

My name is Rubidia Rubio but I go by Rubi (not to be confused with Ruby the programming language -> got some dad jokes!) I am a full stack software developer student with years of experience in healthcare; working in healthcare has provided me with valuable skills needed in web development. Skills such as critical thinking, multitasking, attention to detail, and effective communication skills to name a few. I am a fast learner and hardworking student! I'm ready for my career in technology and I cannot wait to see where this path will take me!

- 👩‍💻 I’m currently learning ...Node.js!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...projects where I can use my recent acquired knowledge and learn more as I go!
